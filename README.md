# Systematic Program Design  
Welcome to my Systematic Program Design project! This project is part of the Open Source Society University (OSSU) Computer Science curriculum. Course description stays:

> The course takes a unique approach to learning programming by focusing on a systematic programming method rather than a specific programming language. This practical method helps me channel my creativity to program well in any language.   

I also enjoy playing with Lisp-like languages and was looking for something similar to SICP book :) 

Course could be found at [Edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+2T2015)

## Requirements 
* DrRacket IDE: This course requires the DrRacket integrated development environment (IDE), which supports the teaching languages used in the course.
* BSL (Beginning Student Language): The programming exercises in this course use BSL, a language created by the course authors and based on the Lisp family of languages.
* Starter files for the course could be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ossu/spd-starters). I copied them to the repo to always have them close but removed all solution files to work through them on my own.
